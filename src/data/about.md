# Intro

I am a data engineer at [Cart.com](https://cart.com) where I build tools to empower brands to grow their business. I am particularly interested in projects that touch e-commerce and growth marketing. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At Cart.com, I have learned how to coordinate efforts across the vast field of data science and software engineering to rapidly build data products. I primarily work as a data engineer and lead a team of other data engineers but have broad experience across Cartâ€™s stack.

# Some history

- I was born in Nigeria but raised in Southern California. My parents, being hard working immigrants with humble beginnings, instilled in me a strong work ethic and gratitude for the smallest things in life.

- When I was young I didn't envision I'll end up an engineer. In college I started out as an art major but graduated with a double major in Accountancy and Information systems, the latter being what I actually enjoy doing!

- Speaking of art. Designing data systems and products is fun and exciting maybe because it provides a creative outlet but solves real world problems in ways that can be measured objectively.

- I started my career in ad tech so this has given me a deep understanding of the space.

# I like

- Running
- Basketball
- MMA/Boxing
- Learning

# Fun facts

- I fluctuate between INTP/ENTP when it comes to Myers Briggs.
- I enjoy reading classic literature.
- I enjoy learning theology, natural science, and technology.
- My wife and I spend more time browsing Netflix or Prime for something good to watch than actually watching something; we've watched a few Korean Dramas together but she refuses to watch anything anime.
- One of my favorite books is called Mindset by Carol Dweck. I think grit and character is the key to success.

# I dream of

- Creating products people love using
- Getting more involved at church
- Spending more time connecting with and serving others
- Learning an instrument
- Writing good fiction or at least helping others to
- Travelling the world
- Being able to dunk a basketball again
